You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy) 640K ought to be enough for anybody. (Bill Gates, 1981) Deleted code is debugged code. (Jeff Sickel) The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds)

If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. (Ralph Johnson) Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing. (Gerald Weinberg) If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. (Robert Sewell) It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets. (Alan Cooper)

Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. (Brian Kernigan) There is no programming language–no matter how structured–that will prevent programmers from making bad programs. (Larry Flon) I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes. (Dennie van Tassel) Good code is its own best documentation. (Steve McConnell)
